# Snake-game-Python

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's turtle module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, grows when it eats food, and wraps around the screen edges.

# Features

1. Basic Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys.
2. Food Collection: The snake grows in length when it eats the food.
3. Screen Wrapping: The snake wraps around the screen edges.
4. Self-Collision Detection: The game resets if the snake collides with itself.
